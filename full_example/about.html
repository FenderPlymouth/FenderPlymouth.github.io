            My name is Mr. Fender and I am the computer science and earth science teacher at Plymouth High School in Plymouth, IN. This is my third year teaching after graduating from the University of Northern Colordo (GO BEARS!) with a degree in physics. While at UNCo I worked on the Space Grant team as a stuctural designer, lead programmer, and team leader on several projects inculding a novel muon detection payload for high altitude balloons, a fully autonomous all-terain and amphibious robot, and several high altitude rockets.

            I am originally from Texas but my family moved to Colorado when I was in middle school. I had the great opportunity to attend Culver Military Academy for high school however which is how I first came to the northern Indiana area. I spent several summers working at the Culver summer camps helping to teach drum campers in the Drum and Bugle Corps as well as astronomy nd rocketry. While working at camp I met my beautiful wife who is originally from Plymouth.
          </p>
          <p>
            We got married 4 years ago right after she graduted from college, unfortunatly I still had a year to go before I got my degree. So she moved out to Colorado where we lived for a year while I finished my bachelors. After I graduated my wife wanted to be closer to her family again so we moved back to Plymouth. In April we had a baby girl named Emmalyn who is the center of our little families lives now. (not to mention the cutest little girl in the world)

              <li>Build rockets and robots</li>
              <li>Try my hand at astrophotagraphy</li>
              <li>Play computer games like Age of Empires II and Civilizations V</li>
              <li>Play music</li>
              <li>Write computer programs, and build websites</li>

            The <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/">16 Personalities Test </a> describes my personality as an Assertive Logician. The website descirbes me as loving to idetify pateerns and discover new facts about the world around me. It says that logicians tend to be kind of messy because they are not interested in the day to day activities like maintanence and cleaning (if you look at my desk I think that part is spot on lol) but instead prefer to instead we prefer to spend our time descovering solutions and answers to new and exciting problems.
          </p>
          <p>
            I don't entirly agree with all of the descriptions however becasue it says that i am unlieley to understand emotional complaints or be a bedrock of emotional support for those around me. But if you look at the percentages of the 4 categories I am only 56% thinking and 51% prospecting, while the other traights are 72% introverted and 78% intuitive. If I were to flip the traights that ar closer to 50% then I would be classifed as an advocate which is are described as being people who see their lifes purpose as helping other. They value deep relationships with a small number of people and tend to think "How can I fix this?" when they encounter a problem or unfairness.
          </p>
          <p>
            I think that with anyone, you are not soley one of these personality types but a combination of them that really makes up who you are. I think the combination of these two personality types really describe who I am to a T. I love to find solutions to problems that I find around me. I get excited in discovering new information and I think if it as my lifes goal to help those around me be the best that they can be.
