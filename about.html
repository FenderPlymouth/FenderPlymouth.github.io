            On this page you are going to tell your visitors more about yourself. You will take the <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/">16 Personalities Test </a> and use the results to tell others a little more about yourself. In addition to the personality test you should explain a little more about who you are. What do you want to do after high school? What are your hobbies? What's your favorite class? Think about things that would help to set you apart if you were to use this website on your resume for a job or scholarship.

            My name is Mr. Fender and I am the computer science and earth science teacher at Plymouth High School in Plymouth, IN. This is my third year teaching after graduating from the University of Northern Colordo (GO BEARS!) with a degree in physics. While at UNCo I worked on the Space Grant team as a stuctural designer, lead programmer, and team leader on several projects inculding a novel muon detection payload for high altitude balloons, a fully autonomous all-terain and amphibious robot, and several high altitude rockets.

            I am originally from Texas but my family moved to Colorado when I was in middle school. I had the great opportunity to attend Culver Military Academy for high school however which is how I first came to the northern Indiana area. I spent several summers working at the Culver summer camps helping to teach drum campers in the Drum and Bugle Corps as well as astronomy nd rocketry. While working at camp I met my beautiful wife who is originally from Plymouth.

            We got married 4 years ago right after she graduted from college, unfortunatly I still had a year to go before I got my degree. So she moved out to Colorado where we lived for a year while I finished my bachelors. After I graduated my wife wanted to be closer to her family again so we moved back to Plymouth. In April we had a baby girl named Emmalyn who is the center of our little families lives now. (not to mention the cutest little girl in the world)

              <li>Try my hand at astrophotagraphy</li>
              <li>Play computer games like Age of Empires II and Civilizations V</li>
              <li>Play music</li>
              <li>Write computer programs, and build websites</li>
