                        This part does not need to bee too crazy for now. As we add more pages to our websites you will create an <em>"About Me"</em> page where you will move this information to. You will also take a personality quiz and pust some information about what it thinks your personality type is on that page as well.

                        For now just focus on the things that you like to do both in and out of school. Whats your favorite class? Do you play any sports or do you have a favorite team? WHat computer games do you like to play if any? (FYI...I would crush all of you in Civ V or Age of Empires...)

                        The last thing you need on your webpage for now is a picture of some kind. It can be of anything you want. In my case I put my favorite picture of my little girl below this section.
