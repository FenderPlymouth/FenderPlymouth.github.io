				Several of my students said that it was not possible to create a webpage from scratch with the requirements for the travel page project in 20 minutes. So I accepted the challenge. Below is what I was able to complete in the 20 minute time frame. (In addition to updating the navigation bar on all of the other pages...)

				I strongly believe that Risk! the classic game of world domination is by far the best game on the market today. It is a well rounded original game that combines a healthy amount of strategy with an enjoyable amount of luck driven action that makes every time you play a new experience.

            Revolutionary Gameplay
          </h2>

					<p>
						At the time of its creation Risk! was revolutionary by allowing players far more flexibility in deciding where they would like to move than any other board-game on the market. it one of the first modern games that allows its players to choose where they want to move during their turn. Consider Monopoly(ii), where one's movement is determined by die rolls. Then remember Sorry(iii), Life(iv), Clue(v), Trivial Pursuit(vi) and countless other older games that also take the decision of where to move, or how far or often, arbitrarily out of one's hands. Allowing one to move where one wanted to go was a breakthrough mechanic back in the late 50s. Also, Risk lets one feel powerful for a few turns. Amassing an enormous army in a single province, smashing into a weak line of defense, conquering a continent, and then being wiped off the board the next turn is exhilarating.

            Easy to Learn and Modify
          </h2>

					<p>
						The traditional game of Risk! is very easy to learn. When compared to a game like Axis and Allies or Stratigo, the actual mechanics for gameplay are simple. Without having to learn special traites of individual pieces, countless children have been able to learn the game after only a single play through. <br><br>

            It is this simple game mechanic that makes creating new versions of the classic game simple too. New official versions based around themes like StarWars or Dr. Who. have been released and continue to provide a brand new take and experience without having to learn a whole new set of rules. <br><br>

						In addition the the creation of new official version of the game, because of the simple mechanic it is easy for players to make their own house rules. Connecting game boards, accomplishing secret missions, adding new territories across oceans or even making new units can all be added to the original version of the game with limited to no changes to the game play.
