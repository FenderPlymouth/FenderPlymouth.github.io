                Hi my name is Mr. Fender and I teach computer science at Plymouth High School. I am originally from Texas 
                but my family moved to Colorado when I was in middle school. For high school I went to Culver Military Academy. 
                I taught rocketry and astronomy there over the summer and that is where I met my wife. I graduated from the 
                University of Northern Colorado with a degree in physics. I build rockets and robots and love all thing about 
                science and engeneering. <br> <br>
                
                The panda is my spirit animal. The panda is the symbol of love, wisdom, strength, determination, kindness, 
                and flexibility. As a totem animal, pands belong to the group that helps to solve problems and as a power animal
                have the ability to see all sides of a situation. Plus I think awesome becasue they look cool and they have an 
                extra digit on their paws that can act like a thumb which is not something that most animals have.
