                <h2><strong><em>Why are you taking CSP?</em></strong></h2>
                    <p>
                        Instead of answering why I am taking CSP I am going to talk about why I am teaching it. I think that computer science is an extremly import life skill to have atleast some basic knowledge of. As we have seen so far in class, computers are <em>everywhere</em>! Having some basic knowledge of what is going on whenever you use your device or an understanding of the kind of digital information you are sharing with the world is critical.

                    <p>
                        By the end of the class, I am hoping that you will be able to do the following:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Describe how computers work from the lowest level of abstraction (electrons moving through wires) to the heighest (the user interface that you interact with)</li>
                            <li>Have a basic understanding of the kind of information that you leave behind in the digital world, weather you mean to or not...</li>
                            <li>Create a website</li>
                            <li>Assemble a working computer</li>
                            <li>Write relativly complex computer programs using the language <strong>Python</strong></li>
                        </ul>
