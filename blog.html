      <h3>
        A "blog" (or "web log") is an online journal, which one or multiple people update on a frequent basis,
        like daily, weekly, or monthly. Many new programmers keep blogs to document their journey to becoming
        a programmer, with updates on what they've learned and what they've made. <br><br>

        There are many "blogging engines" out there, like WordPress and Blogger, but in this project, you'll
        make your own blog using HTML and CSS. It should have at least 2 entries, and the table of contents
        should internally link to each entry. Use CSS text properties to style your blog - like changing the font
        family, line height, and font styles of various sections.
